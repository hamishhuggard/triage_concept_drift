    "*Drift* is a change in the distribution of a data stream. A stream $z_1,z_2,\\dots,z_n$ is said to experience drift when\n",

    "However, simply learning that concept drift has occurred is not very helpful.\n",
    "This package therefore separately detects three kinds of concept drift.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P_t(y) \\ne P_{t'}(y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, there is *real drift*, which is a drift in conditional distribution of labels on features:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Most of the time it is only real drift that requires retraining."
